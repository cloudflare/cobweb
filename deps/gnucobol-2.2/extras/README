COBOL source modules MUST compile warning/error free with both
1) -std=default -W -fixed
2) -std=default -W -free

Ideally they SHOULD compile error-free with any of
the non-strict -std options, too.

Further these COBOL modules MUST execute correctly however
they have been compiled (-std=default / non-strict options).
